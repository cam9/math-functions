Various functions and algorithms demonstrated in python.
	Matrices:
		determinant.py:
			A recursive method for determining the determinant of a matrix.
	Fibonacci:
		recursive.py:
			A recursive method to find the nth fibonacci number
		memoized.py:
			A recursive method that memoizes calls for the nth fibonacci number 			to reduce recursion depth for concurrent calls. Try n=1000, then
			doing n=500 followed by n=1000. Also try comparing run time for 
			30 < n < 40 for the memoized version and the recursive version
		iterative.py:
			The iterative method to find the nth fibonacci number
